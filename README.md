# pypwr - Power analysis in Python

This is the Python version of the excellent R package `pwr`, that facilitates
statistical power analysis.

We are attempting to make this quite light weight, with not too many dependencies,
apart from `scipy`, `numpy`.

The tests use the R version as the source of truth.

This is **work in progress**, so code is maybe 90% done.

The plotting is out of scope.

## TODO

- add lots more functions
- lots more docstring
